# Bristo-Air-Quality Data Modelling

# Measuring Air Quality Data Description. 
Levels of various air borne pollutants such as Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (also called particle pollution) are all major contributors to the measure of overall air quality.

For instance, NO2 is measured using micrograms in each cubic metre of air (㎍/m3). A microgram (㎍) is one millionth of a gram. A concentration of 1 ㎍/m3 means that one cubic metre of air contains one microgram of pollutant.

To protect our health, the UK Government sets two air quality objectives for NO2 in their Air Quality Strategy

The hourly objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of one hour.

The annual objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of a year.

The following table shows the colour encoding and the levels for Objective 1 above, the mean hourly ratio, adopted in the UK.

# The following ZIP file provides data ranging from 2004 to 10 February 2022 (five days ago) taken from 18 monitoring stations in and around Bristol.

# There are 18 stations (monitors):

203 => 'Brislington Depot',
206 => 'Rupert Street',
209 => 'IKEA M32',
213 => 'Old Market',
215 => 'Parson Street School',
228 => 'Temple Meads Station',
270 => 'Wells Road',
271 => 'Trailer Portway P&R',
375 => 'Newfoundland Road Police Station',

# Objectives of the Project. 
Learn to model, cleanse, normalize, shard, map, query and analyze substantial real-world data (230mb+);
Understand the data cleansing, normalization and sharding processes by writing PYTHON scripts to process and convert the data to first (cleansed) CSV and then (normalized) SQL;
Design and implement a relational (MySQL) database and then write a PYTHON script to pipe (import) the cleansed data into the appropriate tables ensuring all integrity constraints are met.
Construct and implement a set of SQL queries to extract data using various filters and constraints.
Map (forward engineer) the data to a NoSQL database of your choice (MongoDB, BaseX, CouchBase, ArangoDB etc.)
Write a short, reflective report on the learning outcomes you have achieved.
